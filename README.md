# ITP2 - Final Assignment
## Search Engine

The goal of this assignment is to implement a information retrieval system on a given data set. The information retrieval system must include the following features:

- Find text files related to the user's input.
- Add/Remove file(s) from the system.

## Installation

Compiled using Visual Studio 2019 (With `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`).

In order for this program to work, download the following [files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H4xYcq9sj5W5CvC5mNA0cWkCqK73kSBB?usp=sharing) and place them in the executable's folder.

The folder containing the binary should be something like this:

```
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d----            7/8/2021  4:30 PM                compressed
d----            7/7/2021  7:55 PM                new train
d----            7/7/2021  7:51 PM                resources
-a---           12/3/2021  6:21 PM          32768 A.exe
-a---            7/8/2021  4:30 PM              6 config.txt
-a---            7/8/2021  4:33 PM        4126692 doc_freq.txt
-a---            7/8/2021  4:30 PM       78206882 inverted_index.txt
-a---            7/8/2021  4:30 PM         978866 path.txt
```

Run `A.exe` and it should be pretty straight-foward.
